## Implementation History

### Phase 1: Planning and Documentation
**Date:** [Current Date]  
**Tasks Completed:**
- Created comprehensive PRD based on user requirements
- Generated detailed task list with 10 main tasks and 58 sub-tasks
- Established task management rules and logging system

**Key Decisions Made:**
- Chose Flutter for cross-platform development
- Selected Vosk for offline German ASR
- Selected Mozilla Bergamot for offline German-English translation
- Chose pdf_flutter for PDF generation
- Established offline-first architecture approach

**Context for Next Phase:**
- Ready to begin implementation with Task 1.0: Project Setup and Configuration
- First sub-task: 1.1 Create new Flutter project with proper package structure
- Need to set up Flutter development environment and create project structure

## Current Context

### Next Task to Implement:
**Task 1.1:** Create new Flutter project with proper package structure

### Requirements for Next Task:
- Create new Flutter project
- Set up proper folder structure following Flutter best practices
- Initialize with appropriate project name and configuration
- Prepare for dependency integration in next sub-task

### Dependencies:
- Flutter SDK must be installed
- Android development environment configured
- Project will be created in current workspace directory

### Notes:
- Following task management rules strictly
- Will update this log after each sub-task completion
- Will mark tasks complete in task list file
- Maintaining context for offline-first, mobile-optimized German learning app

## Technical Decisions Log

### Architecture Decisions:
1. **Flutter Framework:** Chosen for cross-platform development and native performance
2. **Offline-First:** All core features (ASR, translation) work without internet
3. **Modular Design:** Separate services for each major functionality
4. **State Management:** Will use Provider or Riverpod for app-wide state

### Technology Stack:
- **ASR:** Vosk (offline German language model)
- **Translation:** Mozilla Bergamot (offline German-English)
- **PDF:** pdf_flutter package
- **Audio:** Flutter TTS for pronunciation
- **YouTube:** youtube-dl or similar for audio extraction

### Performance Targets:
- App size: Under 100MB including models
- Processing time: Under 5 minutes for 30-minute videos
- Accuracy: 95% for word extraction and translation

## Issues and Resolutions

*No issues encountered yet - project in planning phase*

## Next Session Preparation

### Before Next Implementation Session:
1. Read this log to understand current context
2. Read task list to identify next task
3. Read task management rules
4. Verify Flutter development environment is ready
5. Begin with Task 1.1: Create new Flutter project

### Expected Outcomes:
- Flutter project created with proper structure
- Ready to add dependencies in Task 1.2
- Foundation established for all subsequent development
